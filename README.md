# Lead Scoring & Notification Bot

This project is an **automated lead intake and scoring workflow** built in **n8n**. It captures leads from **Typeform**, validates and cleans the data, scores the leads based on budget and interest, stores the data in **Airtable**, and sends **Slack notifications** to alert the sales team for follow-ups.

## 🖼️ Workflow

## ✨ Features
- Captures lead submissions from Typeform.
- Validates essential fields.
- Cleans and formats input data.
- Automatically scores leads as `Cold`, `Warm`, or `Hot`.

## 🧱 Lead Scoring Logic

Implemented via JavaScript node:
- **Hot:** Budget > 5000 and Interest Level is `High`
- **Warm:** Budget > 2000
- **Cold:** Everything else
